# Frog-ish

**Introduction**

For our final project, we created a (frogger-like) game, and named it “Frog-ish” In the game you guide a character from a starting point and ending point. We both wanted to create something interactive, and a game seemed to be the best option for our skill level. By combining various skills we acquired throughout this semester, we were able to create a fully functioning game. 

**Instructions**

Using your arrow keys, guide the red dot to the winzone at the bottom right corner. Along the way, you have to navigate around several in-motion obstacles moving horizontally across the screen. If one hits you before you make it to the end point, the game is over. 

**Milestones**

Our goal was to create a winnable game where you use the keys to guide a character from one side of the screen to another, avoiding in-motion obstacles along the way. We wanted to perhaps add sprites to our game to have an animated character move across the screen. In the end we decided against this, as it would take too much time. We also suggested replacing the obstacles with images of for example busses, in order to give the game a theme. We also decided against this as we preferred the simple aesthetic of what we currently have. 

**Group Responsibilities**

Initially we took this project head on. We both just went for it and tried to code the game in seperate branches. We opted to not divide the work as we did not know who would find better solutions for what. So we had two different versions and then merged our files.
